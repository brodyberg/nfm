# Mission Statement 

Mission statement:  support local farmers by putting on locally sourced farmers markets around the seattle area

So what's the purpose: 
- Why? because no one else is creating *markets* for local farmers
- So what? without markets farmers will not survive
- Who cares? by using the seattle area we can concentrate demand 
- Really? And all this supports small farmers on the land

Purpose: grow the vision from tiny to small

*** Small organic farmers in Washington will never lack markets in which to support themselves, their employees and their communities *** 

point is this is a better description of cause
Doesn't say much about: access, equity, class, market location etc.

# Responsibilities

She has a committment clause - ask her and bring it back

How do we manage conflicts on the nmfa board? how about farmers?

we do not refer to organizational documents
   - irs 1023, irs determination letter, irs 990, bylaws, irs determination letter, articles of incorporation, ***board commitment form (annual document: 2019 "I will continue to ... attend this many meetings, this donation, this fundraising event, treat staff well (need this example)***, ***board job description***, conflict of interest policy, directors and officers insurance policy, 
- insurance against donors suing board
- insurance against employees suing board
- ex. you should read your bylaws about how to add new board members
- review budget and irs form 990
- ensure compliance with all federal, state and local requirements

# Composition 

Get the right people in the room, right tools and forming their cohesiveness. 

Inquiry, application, orientation to tell them about the organization. Have a clear process of recruitment, training and evaluation. Don't just "ask them to serve" - failing to delivery tools and expectations. It's about increasing their perspective to give them ways to benefit the organization. 

Key is to give them job description ahead of time: time committment, what they need to do etc. So not only are there no surprises there are ideas in advance about how to contribute. And a description forces you to articulate what members must actually do or not do - as opposed to having this be implicit or otherwise unknown. 

Evaluation: quick check-ins (3min eval) to help fine tune things like meeting management, engaged vs disengaged people, relationship between ED and board-chair, culture of discussion and encouraging difficult but effective conversations that help the organization grow. It's ok to raise tough questions - otherwise people have an incentive to go around the structure of the board. 

Term-limits for board members: at first orgs want anyone they can get. Term-limits create healthy structures for boards and create new energy. Want to avoid people who care too much or are too involved. Create a "board matrix" (in handout) - male/female/skillsets/industries. Where's growth opportunity. Where are you strong, where are you weak - use this to plan your recruitment. 

It's ok to pick one thing and work on that single thing. Don't have to do all the things. Tackling everything is too much. Have a culture of learning - learn about recruitment that will enhance your own service and foster that during board development. Board development is hard - celebrate the small wins. 

Tools: job descriptions, matrix, assessments, mentoring, learning, board dev comtee, People matter, get the right people and the right tools. 

* [Recruit
* Select
* Orient
* Evaluate]

Who is responsible for board development? Chair and the related committee. 

# Team or Group?

* Team: unified power in same direction
* Group: people with no connection ex. people on a bus

Who are the other people or things who care about a particular purpose on the Purpose Map pg. 7
* Governments at all levels
* Farmers
* Policy makers
* Granters
* Beneficiaries
* Children
* Families
* Neighborhoods
* Health officials

This all translates into the board matrix. Who your board is and who you need. Ask board to use this as a lens. Non-goal is to more of the same perspectives and abilities. Board is not a social club, not a grouping of friends - this disrupts the effectiveness of new members. Avoid tokenization... 

Look, the matrix is tough and fixing diversity is tough but the outcome is the point. Drive it from skills not origin. Use it as a layer of things you are aware of - be aware there's a problem and use this to reflect your community. It's not a determinant or a fill in the gap type of thing, the driver is skills. 

More orgs have a board application (example in document vault) - how do you know anything about folks? ie. to know things about your board members. 

# Culture

"A pattern of beliefs, traditions and practices prevailing when the board convenes to carry out their duties"

Artifacts: 
* Visible structure

Assumptions: 
* Unconscious group norms and beliefs

Actions: 
* 

## Broken Cultures

Broken: 
* Maybe
* No
* Yes

Know if you have these dominant cultures and how to fix them. 

## Conflict

Cognitive conflict helps organizations. Encourage this in a safe way. It's about defending ideas in a productive, learning oriented way. 

## Flow

Yes, job descriptions but honor individuals. People do different things. Colored square chart which plots challenge vs skill to show resulting mood. Conclusion is to consider the resulting stress on role-players. 

## Succession

Two types: planned and unplanned. Talk about this, bring it up and consider all the aspects: insurance, succession planning etc. 

## Three questions for prospective board members: 

1. What made them fall in love with your mission?
2. How will they help us do the work?
3. What role will they play to raise the money we need to raise?

## Break: what are you thinking about?

Driving recruitment from job description to skills keeping in mind the recruitment matrix is going to be interesting. I mean, how much "keeping in mind" do we do here?

# Operations: KNOW

## Board Meetings

It's a gathering for decisions. 

three buckets of learning for all board members: 
* Connection to cause (what's happening in community)
* what's happening *in* our organization
* How to have a board, how to have financials, how to do strategic planning (aka non profit "stuff")

Education about things to think about strategically

She has a sample agenda (in this doc), make it fit the time available, show prioritization. 

Idea: high-brain power things first, not last

Speak with one voice: in the meeting everybody should engage and express their opinion. When a decision is made there is one voice, one story that's it. 

Doing all your board work "in the parking lot" is a culture issue. Call that out if you are board chair. 

## Planning

Alignment of your people, your partnerships and your resources. 

## Evaluation

How do you know you are achieving anything? 

Dashboard ideas: 
- Vendor count annually
- Net per vendor
- Sum of benefits redeemed
- Staff turnover
- Organizational compensation rank

## Committees

You don't have to be a board member to serve on a committee. Have members of the community serve. Great way to recruit board members. 

Committee makes recommendation to the board and the board is what decides. 

## Board/Staff

## Documentation

Attendance policy, board matrix, calendar, committee charters, job descriptions, meeting agendas, minutes, orientation schedule, staff organization chart

## Break: what are you thinking about?

We do nothing with committees period. We could get the people we'd heard about from Clover onto them. Using that agenda template would be interesting and possibly helpful. 

# Fundraising

Appeal to the emotional and the intellectual
It's inspiring to encourage people to give money to a cause they care about. 

Why participating in fundraising is important: 
1. 
2. If board members aren't donors why would anyone else?
3. Board calls much more likely to succeed than staff calls

It's really about creating a culture of gratitude and that people are being welcomed, seen and heard. 

Focus on retention of current and lapsed donors and avoid the obsession with acquisition of new donors. 

Connect people to the work so donors feel like they have an authentic connection to the work. 

People want to know your story as well, how you are connected, how you love the org and to hear your story as well. 

Donation cycle: cultivation, solicitation, stewardship (thank, share impact and gratitude)

Explain how all these pieces are part of fund raising. So fund raising isn't about just "the ask." 

Get donors out to a farm. Get them to a kitchen. Get them to a chef-supplied kitchen. Goal is to have an organic conversation where you connect the person to help create more of this work. 

Events: have a defined purpose. Is it a celebration? A fund raiser? How do we structure it to support that agenda and make it intentional rather than a place people arrive and leave with no specific scope. How about turning lapsed donors into current donors or $100 donors into monthly donors. Be clear about the goal. Goals reduce the pressure. 

Boards resist fundraising sometimes due to a feeling of lack of ownership, help them get there and it will feel more natural to have an authetic conversation about values and beliefs that connects people to the organization. It's about finding people aligned with mission and values. 

If you ask for x board member should model x where x is volunteering, gifting etc etc

# Fundraising

- bring people to a farm
- show people the new flowers
- show people the newly plowed fields

## Roles

Everyone is involved. Know your role (in the three things: cultivate, steward, ask etc.)

Have information in place to support their role. 

Case for support document - aka "what are you going to do with the money?"

## Planning

Support docs

## Break: what are you thinking about?

I think I'd love this and over time be good at it. I think the opportunities given all the farm things is huge.
