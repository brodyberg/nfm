# Finance Unlocked for Nonprofits

## Goals
* Know more about nonprofit finance
* Have what you need to improve
* Be ready to share FUN with others

Everything is online, so it's all available later. 

It's about linking mission and finance. It's about identifying problems before they happen. 

## Why does nonprofit finance matter?

We have a lot of cash running around
Responsibility
Builds into plans and campaigns
General survival
Hiring and sustained employment

Everyone needs to be paying attention 

## 5 Questions

1. Liquidity: cash in the bank?
2. Solvency: 
3. Profitability: generating more than spending?
4. Efficiency: How well do you use your money?
5. Impact: are you doing what you set out to do?

# Balance Sheet

Basic thing: It's about where the organization is financially. It's a snapshot. You can compare one to another, across orgs. 

Assets list are all about liquidity. Can you spend your money?

Arranged in terms of how fast you can access it: instant, three months, a year ets. 

Then it talks about what we owe to others. 

## What to look for? 
* Current <b>assets</b> vs current liabilities. Watch this ratio to see what our plan is to handle that. 
* <b>Reserves</b>: are we saving the right amount?
* Strange things: new, wierd stuff here?
* <b>Liabilities</b>? new strange debt?
* Emergency access to cash?

## Needed for boards:
* Should get a balance sheet and income statement every month. Two super important things to drive the car
* Ensure reports are the right amount of detail, not too much, not too little. Finance team/committee can sharpen this to board attention/qualification level

Goal is not to be a finance expert but to be able to ask questions. 

If your org has target ratios, you need to present those calculations to the board in the reports. Board members will not calculate this themselves. 

Show line of credit even if it has no balance otherwise it will be hidden. 

## Definition: Current

Means "twelve months" you either can get it or you have to pay it eg. "current liabilities", "current assets"

## Net Assets

```assets - liabilities = net assets```
<br/>
.. algebra: 
<br/>
```assets = liabilities + net assets```

# Income Statement

All board members should get it every month. Income statement/profit and loss/P&L. It's about a period of time rather than just a picture. Can be organized many ways. Top: what people gave us. Bottom: what we spent. 

Every org, every year should approve a budget. Transparency, accountability and etc. 

Plan and reality, third column is the variance between plan and reality. 

## Look For

Compare story of org to income statement. Take what ED says or development committee to compare, ask questions to understand variances. What's a meaningful variance to org? Why are we off plan? It's important to understand each variance to ensure we are where we need to be at the end of the year. Are we dependent on one source? How do we diversify in case revenue source changes?

Get the right level of detail for your org, not too long, too short. Board members need right level of focus for best questions. Suggestion: fit to one page. Absolutely show variance since board members will not calculate things themselves. 

## What they cover

* Period of time
* Budget
* Actuals
* Reporting
* Revenue diversification

## Cash vs. Accrual

* Cash: count it if you have it
* Accrual: count it if it's headed your way ever

## Notes

Use comments and narrative on your income statement to shape a more accurate picture for funders or people who wouldn't know otherwise. Goal is to identify and address logic jumps where you had to make up what was happening in this example. 

# 990 

IRS 990. Do it regardless of your budget size. Page 6, super important for everyone, and also, you may grow, so you will have to eventually pay attention to the 990. Particularly as your organization grows you want to look ahead at the next required versions of the 990. 

## Know

* Public document, uploaded to candid.org
* Donors can have an account on candid and what they see is what's on your 990
* Give page 2 to the people that do the work. Sing the praises of the organization. Use good and complete writing. 
* Page 6: checkboxes about governance. So these are just good practice questions, nothing bad will happen if you say 'no' to something but it something where you'd want to be in the good practices column. 

## Deadlines

4 1/2 months after end of fiscal year + extensions. 

# Giving

You are given resources to complete the mission, and do not get anything in return and you don't have to earn revenue. 

## Pledges

Donor pledges to make you a gift in the future. Verbal. Form. Single gift or multi-year, lots of different forms. 

Not about cash, it's about recording the promise. 

Do we ask for pledges? How do they appear? How do you see when they are due?

## In Kind

Donor gives you goods or services. Eg. computer equipment, rent, supplies, software.

Restrictions: only donors can restrict gifts
* Permanent: endowment gift which has strict rules apply forever
* Temporary: specific focus on something definite
* Unrestricted: for your mission work

Board members should know what you ask for, how you track them and manage stewardship. 

### Tracking

Need to figure out tracking. Is there some value threshold? What matters? Even placeholders for this are valuable because they call out things currently free which may change in the future (ex. rent). 

## Communication

People asking gifts should communicate with those tracking them (all the work to manage tracking and restrictions etc.)

## Gift acceptance policy

What you do and do not take. Like a registry. 

# Oversight

Boards of Directors can be found liable for incompetent oversight. You do not want to watch money go out the back door. Board is responsible for controls - the rules of the household to protect assets and that reports are reliable. And it's key these rules are written. 

And we use the rules to guide access and limiting access to assets: write checks, debit cards, who can touch cash etc. 

"Trust is not an internal control" - hold people accountable, aka book-keepers. Trust but verify. 

Protect assets and systems aka accounting and payroll system etc. 

"Segregation of Duties": 
* <b>access</b> | <b>authorization</b> | <b>record-keeping</b>
* Check and balance 

Constant awareness of the rules each year
Brainstorming risks to the organization
Do spot-checks aka mini-audits

Digital access: access to the bank online etc etc (specify access by role)
Set up alerts on access

Identify the rules, have them in writing for new officers. 

Two signatures on check is just for your internal controls not for the bank. 

Phishing is a real thing. Every quarter. "From ED, to finance person, says 'send me $20k now!'" 

# Change your Habits

* Talk in smaller groups than the entire board. Do exercises as a smaller group
* Train someone up
* Just train on something small, not whole thing
* Draw budget in markers or crayons

Mix it up
